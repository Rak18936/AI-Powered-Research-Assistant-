# AI-Powered Research Assistant (Automated Literature Reviews)

Built a document intelligence and research automation pipeline applying AI agent design principles from Google's kaggle AI Agents Intensive Course. The system retrieves academic papers, analyzes PDFs, and generates synthesized literature reviews through automated workflows.

## 🎓  Student Researcher Alignment

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Automated extraction of research objectives, methodology, and experimental results from unstructured PDFs.
* **Information Retrieval**: Live integration with academic databases (arXiv API) using custom queries.
* **Systems & Software Engineering**: Implementing robust data parsing pipelines, fault-tolerant network downloads, and an offline local compiler fallback.

## 🚀 Setup & Execution Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
Open your PowerShell/Terminal in this directory and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Search and Fetch Papers
Run the fetcher script to retrieve metadata:
```bash
python paper_fetcher.py
```
* **Input**: Enter any research topic (e.g., *"Prompt Caching"* or *"Anomaly Detection"*).
* **Output**: Top 5 papers will be fetched and saved in the `output/` folder.

### 3. Set your Claude API Key (Optional)
If you have an active key, load it into your environment:
* **PowerShell**: `$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_actual_key_here"`
* **Command Prompt**: `set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here`

*(If no key is configured or if the key is out of credits, the pipeline automatically switches to **Offline Mode** to run all SQL and compilation steps locally for free!)*

### 4. Compile the Literature Review
Run the agent script to build the synthesis report:
```bash
python lit_review_agent.py
```
* **Output**: Generates **`output/literature_review.md`** featuring:
  * Executive Summaries.
  * Side-by-side **Comparative Tables**.
  * Formal **IEEE** & **APA** bibliography references.

### 5. Download and Deep-Analyze PDFs
Run the analyzer script to pull full papers:
```bash
python pdf_analyzer.py
```
* **Interaction**: Choose specific paper numbers (e.g., `1,3`) or type `all` to analyze the entire list.
* **Output**: Downloads PDFs to `output/pdfs/` and compiles a detailed analysis of their **Methodology**, **Experiments**, and **Results** inside **`output/full_pdf_analysis.md`**.
